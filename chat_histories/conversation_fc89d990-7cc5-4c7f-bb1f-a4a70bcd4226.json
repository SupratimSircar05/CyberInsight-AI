It focused on Governance and Protection, with a planned follow-up audit in 2021-22 on Detection, Response, and Resolution. The audit revealed several key weaknesses, leading to a **Limited Assurance** opinion.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* **Priority 1 (High):** Lack of recent penetration testing, a crucial practice for identifying vulnerabilities in the network and infrastructure.\n* **Priority 2 (Medium):**\n    * Insufficient resources dedicated to cybersecurity, with only one dedicated staff member compared to peers with 3-4.\n    * Unstructured and infrequent cyber awareness reminders and notifications, compounded by a lack of a formal training program.\n    * No \"phishing\" exercises conducted to test staff susceptibility to social engineering attacks.\n    * Reliance on Capita as an IT service provider without sufficient evidence of their cybersecurity controls.\n    * Infrequent reviews of privileged/administrator accounts, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.\n    * No defined timeframe for disabling or removing outdated firewall rules.\n* **Priority 3 (Low):**\n    * Outdated Information Security Management System (ISMS) document.\n    * Information/Cyber Security related policies not updated regularly.\n\n**Management Response and Action Plan:**\n\nThe Council acknowledged the findings and outlined an action plan to address the identified weaknesses. This includes:\n\n* Conducting penetration testing in the 2021/22 financial year.\n* Recruiting an additional Incident and Security Officer.\n* Implementing mandatory cybersecurity training for all staff.\n* Procuring a phishing simulator tool and incorporating phishing awareness into training.\n* Working with Capita to improve visibility of their controls and potentially renegotiating contract terms.\n* Implementing regular reviews of privileged accounts.\n* Reviewing and amending firewall configurations, policies, and documentation.\n* Reviewing the ISMS document and implementing regular reviews of cyber policies.\n\n**Deadlines:**\n\nDeadlines for implementing the actions range from August 2021 to March 2022, with some ongoing activities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe audit highlights significant areas for improvement in Croydon Council's cybersecurity posture. The Council's action plan, if implemented effectively, should strengthen their defenses and reduce the risk of cyberattacks. However, continuous monitoring and improvement are crucial in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. \n"]}]
