[{"role": "user", "parts": ["Top 10 findings of this report"]}, {"role": "model", "parts": ["Here are the top 10 findings from the Croydon Cyber Security Audit Report of June 2021, based on priority and potential impact:\n\n**Priority 1 (High)**\n\n1. **Lack of Recent Penetration Testing (Issue 1):** The Council has not undertaken recent penetration testing of its network and infrastructure, which is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring system security. This is a common practice among peers and should be done at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes are proposed to the IT environment.\n2. **Outdated Information Security Management System (ISMS) (Priority 3 Issue 1):** While the Council has a well-defined organizational structure and an ISMS document in place, the document is outdated (last updated November 2019). An updated ISMS is essential for defining roles, responsibilities, and processes related to cybersecurity in the face of evolving threats.\n\n**Priority 2 (Medium)**\n\n3. **Insufficient Resources for Cybersecurity (Issue 2):** Compared to local government peers, the Council has insufficient resources dedicated to cybersecurity, with only one member of staff compared to many other organizations having at least three or four team members. This lack of resources hinders the Council's ability to effectively manage and mitigate cyber risks.\n4. **Unstructured Cybersecurity Awareness Programme (Issue 3):** Cybersecurity awareness reminders and notifications are unstructured and not formally scheduled on a regular basis. This lack of a formal training program contributes to the \"weak link\" in an organization's cyber security defense, leaving staff vulnerable to phishing and other social engineering attacks.\n5. **Lack of Regular Phishing Simulation Exercises (Issue 4):** The Council has not undertaken or planned to undertake regular \"phishing\" exercises for its staff. These exercises are crucial for training staff to identify and avoid phishing attacks, which are a common and effective method used by hackers.\n6. **Reliance on IT Service Provider for Management of Cyber Risks (Issue 5):** While reliance on a service provider (Capita) for IT is common, the Council has limited visibility of Capita's controls related to cybersecurity risks. This lack of visibility and control can expose the Council to potential vulnerabilities and security breaches.\n7. **Inadequate Privileged/administrator Account Reviews (Issue 6):** Although Active Directory Domain reviews have been conducted, they are not formally scheduled or undertaken regularly enough. This poses a risk as privileged accounts with elevated access rights can be exploited if not properly managed and reviewed.\n8. **Absence of Timeframe for Firewall Rule Review (Issue 7):** There is no timeframe defined for disabling or removing firewall rules that are no longer needed. This can lead to an accumulation of outdated rules, potentially creating security vulnerabilities and hindering network performance.\n\n**Priority 3 (Low)**\n\n9. **Cybersecurity Policies Not Regularly Reviewed (Priority 3 Issue 2):** The Council has cybersecurity policies and controls in place, but they are not updated on a regular basis. This can leave the Council exposed to emerging threats and risks that are not addressed by outdated policies.\n10. **Lack of a Full Cybersecurity Core Document Review (Priority 3 Issue 1):** While a full cybersecurity \"core\" document review is planned for Q1 2022, its current absence may hinder the Council's ability to comprehensively assess and address its cybersecurity posture.\n\n\nThese findings highlight key areas where the Council needs to take action to improve its cybersecurity posture and mitigate potential risks. Addressing these issues will strengthen the Council's defenses against cyber threats and ensure the security of its systems and data. \n"]}]
